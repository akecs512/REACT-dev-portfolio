        Computers and art have always had significant influences on me. After
        completing my Bachelors in Visual Arts with an emphasis in art history
        and criticism, I decided to combine my interests by taking courses in
        graphic arts, and recently decided to take my computer skills to the
        next level by learning software development. I am advancing my knowledge
        and experience in computer coding through a University of Texas
        bootcamp.
